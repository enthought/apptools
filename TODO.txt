* Take a critical look at whether apptools.template should be in this project.
  It appears to be adding a lot of dependencies the other packages do not need.
  For now, its use is controlled through an extra.

* Refactor the state_pickler.py module to break the need to import
  tvtk at all.

* Check to see if the pyface.resource package is redundant with the
  envisage.resource code.  If so, let's minimize to one location.
  Note that, at least as of Jan 2008, we are considering moving
  pyface.resource into the TraitsGUI project to resolve issues with
  dependencies there.

* Port apptools.help to envisage2, currently it relies on the old envisage,
  and is excluded from the tests.
